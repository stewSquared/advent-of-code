# Advent of Code Solutions

My Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), written in Scala 3

## Usage

Solutions are in Scala 3 worksheet files. To run these, files need to be opened in an editor running [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/). Intellij *might* also work, but I haven't used its worksheets.

Input files are not distributed, as per the AoC creator's request. A [script](input.sh) is included that will save your problem input to the appropriate path. To use it, you will need your advent of code session key:

```bash
AOC_SESSION=<your session key here>
source ./input.sh
aoc-input <year> <day>
```

## Videos

Most of these solutions are live on streamed on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/stewSquared). VODs will eventually be published on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@stewSquared). If you found code in this repository helpful, consider following me on either of these platforms.
