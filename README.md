## Usage

Solutions are in Scala 3 worksheet files. To run these, files need to be opened in an editor running [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/). Intellij *might* also work, but I haven't used its worksheets.

Input files are not distributed, as per the AoC creator's request. A [script](input.sh) is included that will save your problem input to the appropriate path. To use it, you will need your advent of code session key:

```bash
AOC_SESSION=<your session key here>
source ./input.sh
aoc-input <year> <day>
```

## Videos

Starting 2023 these solutions are live streamed on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@stewSquared) and [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/stewSquared). VODs will be available long-term on YouTube. Check out [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnP_dObOt-rWnSqOUQDc5T_r9TMdaNxJl) for all 2023 videos. If you found code in this repository interesting, consider following me on either of these platforms.
